##  Use Case

This dataset is primarily used to:

- Train regression models (e.g., Decision Trees, Linear Regression)
- Explore relationships between car features and pricing
- Perform feature engineering (e.g., label encoding, one-hot encoding)
- Build a web app (e.g., with Streamlit) for MSRP prediction

---

## Libraries

- `pandas` for data preprocessing  
- `scikit-learn` for modeling and pipelines  
- `joblib` for saving the model  
- `Streamlit` for creating an interactive dashboard  

---

## File Info

- Format: `.csv`
- Rows: ~10,000+
- Source: Aggregated from public automotive listings

---

## How to use?

- Download the files from github
- place the model and pipeline in same directory of main.py or manually set the path 
- Make sure to install streamlit , pandas, numpy, sklearn beforehand
- run the main.py through Streamlit run main.py command in terminal
